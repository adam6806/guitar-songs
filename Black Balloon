Baby's Black Balloon makes her fly

I almost fell into that hole in your life

And you're not thinking bout tomorrow

VERSE 2:
D                            G
1,000 other boys could never reach you
D                         G
How could I have been the one
D                      G
I saw the world spin beneath you
    Riff 1
And scatter like ice from the spoon
     G        A     G
That was your woooooooooomb


CHORUS:
Bm    A        G            D
Comin down the world turned over
    Bm     A        G       D
And angels fall without you there
    Bm   A     G       D
And I go on as you get colder
   G       A
Or are you someone's prayer


INTRO
D-G-D-G


VERSE 3:
D                             G
You know the lies they always told you
D                      G
And the love you never knew
D                            G
What's the things they never showed you
     Riff 1
That swallowed the light from the sun
  G         A            G
Inside your rooooooooom, yeeaah


CHORUS:
Bm    A        G            D
Comin down the world turned over
    Bm     A        G       D
And angels fall without you there
    Bm   A     G       D
And I go on as you get colder
G      A
Always someone
