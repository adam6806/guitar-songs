Save Tonight

Am F C G x4

    Am     F     C     G 
Go on and close the curtains
    Am     F     C     G 
'Cause all we need is candlelight
    Am     F     C     G
You and me and the bottle of wine
    Am     F     C     G
And hold you tonight... oh eee
    Am     F     C     G
Well we know I'm going away
    Am     F     C     G
And how I wish I wish it weren't so
    Am     F     C     G
So take this wine and drink with me
    Am     F     C     G
Let's delay our misery...

[2x]
    Am     F
Save tonight
    C      G
Fight the break of dawn
    Am     F
Come tomorrow
    C      G
Tomorrow I'll be gone

There's a log on the fire
And it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire..
To take me away
It ain't easy to say goodbye
Darling please don't start to cry
'Cause girl you know I've got to go
And Lord I wish it wasn't so

[2x]
Save tonight
Fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone

Am     F     C     G 
Tomorrow comes to take me away
Am     F     C     G 
I wish that I, that I could stay
Am     F     C     G 
But girl you know I've got to go, oh
Am     F     C     G 
And Lord I wish it wasn't so

[2x]
Save tonight
Fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
