*Capo 2nd Fret*

Intro :  A - D - A - D
(Verse 1)
A                              D
The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful
A                        E   D
Stop me and steal my breath
A                        D
Emeralds from mountains thrust towards the sky
A                        E    D
Never revealing their depth
A    E      D         E
Tell me that we belong together
A        E          D           E
Dress it up with the trappings of love
A        E         D              E
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
A                             E                     D    E
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above


(Chorus 1)
           A       D
     And I'll be your crying shoulder
     A         E   D
     I'll be loves suicide
     A       D
     I'll be better when I'm older
     A             E      D          A         D-A-E-D
     I'll be the greatest fan of your life

(Verse 2)
A            D
Rain falls angry on the tin roof
A                      E    D
As we lie awake in my bed
A                     D
You're my survival, you're my living proof
A                     E    D
My love is alive not dead
A     E      D          E
Tell me that we belong together
A        E            D           E
Dress it up with the trappings of love
A         E              D        E
I'll be captivated I'll hang from your lips
A                           E                      D   E
Instead of the gallows of heartache, that hang from above

(REPEAT CHORUS)
(Pre-Chorus)
F#m
And I've dropped out, burned up, 
F                          E
fought my way back from the dead
F#m     
Tuned in, turned on, 
F                              D     B    E
remembered the thing that you said
(CHORUS)
