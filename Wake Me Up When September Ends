Wake Me Up When September Ends

G          Bm
Summer has come and passed
    Em           D
The innocent can never last
C               Cm        G
Wake me up when September ends


G                Bm
Like my fathers' come to pass
Em              D
Seven years has gone so fast
C               Cm        G    G/F#
Wake me up when September ends


Em             Bm
Here comes the rain again
C                G     G/F#
Falling from the stars
Em             Bm
Drenched in my pain again
C               D
Becoming who we are


G         Bm
As my memory rests
    Em            D
But never forgets what I lost
C               Cm        G
Wake me up when September ends

G            Bm
Ring out the bells again
Em               D
Like we did when spring began
C               Cm        G    G/F#
Wake me up when September ends


Em             Bm
Here comes the rain again
