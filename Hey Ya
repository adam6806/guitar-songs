Hey Ya

C             F
My baby don't mess around
            F
Because she loves me so
          Cmaj9     Am7
And this I know for sure
C            F
But does she really wanna
          F
But can't stand to see me
    Cmaj9    Am7
Walk out the door
C            F
Don't try to fight the feeling
            F                       Cmaj9     Am7
Because the thought alone is killing me right now
C             F
Thank god for mom and dad
              F
For sticking two together
          Cmaj9      Am7
'Cause we don't know how.

Chorus:
     C   F
And, Hey Ya
Cmaj9  Am7
Hey    Ya
C   F
Hey Ya
Cmaj9  Am7
Hey    Ya

C
You think you've got it
F
Ohh, you think you've got it
    F
But got it just don't get it
              Cmaj9      Am7
Till' there's nothing at all.
C
We get together
F
Oh, we get together
    F                                     Cmaj9    Am7
But seperate's always better when there's feelings involved.
C                   F
If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
     Cmaj9            Am7
Then what makes, Then what makes, Then what makes, Then what makes,
Cmaj9    Am7
Love the exception?
C
So why you, why you
F                             F
Why you, why you, why you are we so in denial
        Cmaj9          Am7
When we know we're not happy here

Now I wanna see y'all on y'alls baddest behavior
C            F

Cmaj9     Am7
