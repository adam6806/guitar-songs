A Long December

Intro-
G    C    Am    C
G    C    Am


Verse 1-
C          G                  D           Am
  A long December and there's reason to believe
      C                 G               C *
Maybe this year will be better than the last
 Am             C       G                   D
   I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were
Am
leavin'
        G             C
Now the days go by so fast
         G               C         Am **
And it's one more day up in the canyons
         G              C          Am
And it's one more night in Hollywood
       G                  C     Am
If you think that I could be forgiven... I wish you would.


Chorus-
G            C    Am            C
   Na, na-na, na. Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na.
G            C    Am
   Na, na-na, na. Yeah..

Verse 2-
 C              G            D
   The smell of hospitals in winter
        Am                C            G
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no
 C
pearls
Am        C              G               D
   All at once you look across a crowded room
           Am               G           C
To see the way that light attaches to a girl
         G               C         Am
And it's one more day up in the canyons
         G                 C       Am
And it's one more night in Hollywood
       G               C           Am
If you think you might come to California... I think you should


Chorus-
G            C    Am            C
   Na, na-na, na. Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na.
G            C    Am
   Na, na-na, na. Yeah...

Bridge-

Verse 3-
 C             G              D              Am
   Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.
    C               G               C
And talked a little while about the year
Am             C                G              D
   I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,
           Am            G               C
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not
show her
                C    G                    D           Am
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
      C                 G               C
Maybe this year will be better than the last
Am           C               G               D
   I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself
   Am               G               C
To hold on to these moments as they pass
         G               C         Am
And it's one more day up in the canyons
         G              C          Am
And it's one more night in Hollywood
     G                       C            Am
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean... I guess I should


Chorus-
G            C    Am            C
   Na, na-na, na. Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na.
G            C    Am
   Na, na-na, na. Yeah...
